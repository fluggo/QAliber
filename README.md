# QAliber

QAliber is a free GUI test automation tool for Windows.
You can extend it by writing new test steps.

This is a fork of the original [Sourceforge project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qaliber/) by benjicoh, homfri, and tombriggs2.
I wasn't able to find their email addresses to give them proper credit.
This fork fixes many bugs, uses a parseable XML file format, and adds XPath-based control locators.
It also adds [Windows UI Automation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32) support, which can be augmented by the application under test to make the test program more responsive.

This fork was written by Brian Crowell, with special thanks to the organization that supported this project, who has asked to remain anonymous.
